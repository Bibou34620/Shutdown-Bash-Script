<h1>The Shutdown Bash Script</h1>
<h3>The Shutdown Bash Script is a script to shutdown your PC (lol)</h3>

<h2><em>Recommandations</em></h2>
To run this script I recommend that you install xterm on your machine because I tried with gnome-terminal (the default terminal under Mint Yes, I'm under Mint) And it didn't work so much to install it nothing more simple

Go to your favorite terminal and type `sudo apt install xterm`
